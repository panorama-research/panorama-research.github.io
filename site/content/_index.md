<p>The Panorama project boosts design efficiency for heterogeneous automotive and aerospace systems. Based in open source, it provides an environment for collaboration amongst diverse hardware and software technologies and teams, especially at the early stages of design. It supports efficient design decisions by defining evolving standards, tools and best practises for exchange of non-functional, formal models.</p>

<br/>
<p>Panorama addresses the development of future mobility systems by providing solutions for overcoming the challenges of this threefold heterogeneity:</p>
<li>Integration of heterogeneous function domains, for example on centralized computing platforms</li>
<li>Use of heterogeneous specialized hardware</li>
<li>Involvement of heterogeneous, collaborating parties for design and development</li>

<p>Initiated in April 2019, the project will focus on the following use-cases over its 3 year period, building on the Eclipse APP4MC and Eclipse Capra open source communities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Exchange of system models in cross-company, collaborative development projects</li>
<li>Assessment of different hardware architectures for a given software.</li>
<li>Assessment of deployment alternatives for a given software onto a given hardware architecture.   Guidance for optimization of system level design decisions by visualizing analysis results.</li>
<li>Guidelines for secure model exchange in collaborative development projects.</li>
