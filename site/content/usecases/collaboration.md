Title: Collaboration

The times when an OEM could dump a requirements specification on a Tier-1 supplier and expect them to come back after six months with a finished product are over. A heterogeneous set of organisations working together to create novel and innovative products requires a new approach to collaboration. OEMs and suppliers on different tiers need to be able to exchange information freely and securely in order to efficiently work together. At the same time, safety and security standards such as ISO2700x, IEC62443, or IEC61508 need to be observed and data privacy and integrity needs to be ensured to protect the individual partnerâ€™s IP.
Panorama is going to provide technical, procedural, and organisational solutions to this problem. The partners in the project will develop collaborative tools and exchange formats, but also coordination mechanisms, distributed roles, and cooperation models that are applicable in industrial practice.
