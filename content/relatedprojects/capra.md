Eclipse Capra is a traceability management tool that is hosted by the Eclipse Modeling project. Capra allows the creation of trace links between arbitrary artefacts and provides features to edit them, keep them consistent, and visualise the relationships between them. This includes traceability matrices and graph visualisations that are helpful for change impact analysis and reporting.
