The Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts was founded in 1971 and focuses on study and teaching towards practical problem-solving, taught by highly experienced professors, cementing the link between theory and practice. True to this philosophy, the university offers over 50 study options, in seven different faculties: applied social sciences, architecture, design, computer sciences, economics, engineering, information technology and electrical engineering. More than 13,500 students are currently enrolled at Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts.

IDiAL (Institute for Digital Transformation of Application and Living Domains) is set up as a joint and interdisciplinary initiative of the Faculty of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering and the Faculty of Computer Science of the Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts in 2017. The IDiAL Institute works on processes, methods and tools for the development of Intelligent Technical Systems - primarily for mechatronic and embedded systems. Such processes, tools and methods are tailored, optimized and finally validated within industrial applications in the relevant industries. For this reason, a close cooperation with both academia and industry is necessary. Therefore, IDiAL is positioned as a house of competence for the transfer, adaptation and optimization of scientific results into industrial application.
