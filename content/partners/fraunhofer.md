The Fraunhofer Institute for Mechatronic Systems Design IEM in Paderborn possesses outstanding competencies in the field of “Intelligent Technical Systems”. Its three departments Product Development, Control Technology and Software Engineering concentrate on the development of mechatronic systems and the conception of the necessary production systems. The group develops new tools and techniques for the development of mechatronic products, model-based designs, and efficient systems as well as software solutions. This is done in applied research projects in close cooperation with companies, thereby helping them to manage the change to mechatronics and to develop innovative intelligent technical systems. In this project, contributions will be made by the Software Engineering department of the group.
