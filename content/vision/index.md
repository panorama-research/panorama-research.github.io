The PANORAMA project boosts design efficiency for heterogeneous automotive and aerospace systems. Based in open source, it provides an environment for collaboration amongst diverse hardware and software technologies and teams, especially at the early stages of design. It supports efficient design decisions by defining evolving standards, tools and best practices for exchange of non-functional, formal models.

Software developers in the automotive and aircraft industries will face major challenges in the future. Future mobility will be electrified, automated and highly networked. As a result, mobility systems will be subject to radical changes in the way E/E architectures are designed, software and hardware are integrated, and development processes are shaped. Three central, heterogeneous fields of tension are emerging:

- The application of heterogeneous, i.e., specialized and networked hardware (e.g., drive, comfort, multimedia,...) are integrated within central hardware platforms.
- Future development processes will be designed collaboratively by several heterogeneous partners (OEM, Tier 1, and Tier 2 suppliers) along the value chain. In particular, Software providers, domain experts, and service providers will become more involved in future development processes.
- The application of heterogeneous, i.e., specialized and networked hardware (e.g., AI-Accelerator for the realization of Deep Learning), will become necessary.

PANORAMA addresses these issues through an open ecosystem of software for efficient collaborative design.
